## [1.7.1] - 2025-01-28

### Fixed
- **Email Formatting Bug** - HTML and formatting now displays correctly in all emails
  - Removed double sanitization that was stripping HTML formatting
  - Proposal details in emails now preserve bold, italic, lists, and other formatting
  - Data is still securely sanitized once with `wp_kses_post()` when saved to database
  - Affected templates: user-proposals.php, admin-notification.php, admin-authorization-complete.php, admin-acceptance-notification.php
- **Line Breaks Not Displaying in Emails** - Line breaks and paragraphs now render properly
  - Added `wpautop()` function to convert plain text line breaks to HTML `<p>` and `<br>` tags
  - Single line breaks â†’ `<br>` tags
  - Double line breaks â†’ `<p>` paragraph tags with proper spacing
  - Works with WYSIWYG editor content while preserving existing HTML
  - Fixed in all 4 email templates
- **Critical Security Bug** - Email links now properly invalidate when admin manually closes entry
  - User response links (Accept/Reject) are now invalid if admin closes entry before user responds
  - Auction house authorization links are now invalid if admin closes entry before authorization
  - Prevents responses from being processed after admin has manually closed an entry
  - Added entry status validation in `handle_proposal_response()` and `handle_authorization_response()` methods
  - Users see clear error message: "This request has been closed by the administrator. This link is no longer valid."
  - Ensures complete admin control over entry workflow

### Security
- Email link validation now includes entry status check
- Prevents unauthorized responses after manual entry closure
- Proper error messaging for closed entry link attempts

### Technical Details
- Updated `class-proposal-response-handler.php` with entry status validation
- Modified all email templates to use `wpautop()` for line break conversion
- Removed redundant `wp_kses_post()` calls from email output (data already sanitized on save)

## [1.7.0] - 2025-01-27

### Added

  - Unified badge styling across all status columns
  - Green color scheme for Accepted/Approved (changed from purple)
  - Authorization date displayed when approved
- **Rejection History Filtering**
  - Only shows rejected/invalid proposals (excludes accepted/authorized)

### Database
- **Version 1.4 Migration**
  - Creates `wp_aees_proposal_history` table
  - Columns: id, entry_id, proposal_uid, proposal_title, proposal_price, proposal_details, status, user_email, user_response_date, authorization_status, authorization_date, authorized_by, created_at
  - Indexes on entry_id, proposal_uid, status, user_response_date, created_at
  - Automatic migration of existing rejected/accepted proposals
  - Runs once on first admin visit after update
  - Duplicate prevention during migration

### Performance
- Query optimization: Entry status fetched in single JOIN
- History queries use indexed columns for fast retrieval
- Efficient duplicate checking on history inserts

### UI/UX Improvements
- Response Status Boxes: "Awaiting customer response" â†’ "Awaiting customer acceptance"
- Authorization status shows "N/A - Proposal declined" when user rejects
- Entry Status badges added to main dashboard with lock icons
- All status badges use consistent `.aees-approval-*` class structure
- Green gradient badges for positive responses (Accepted/Approved)

- Yellow badges for pending states
- Red badges for declined/rejected states

### Developer Notes

- Updated method: `get_rejection_history($entry_id)` now reads from history table
- Updated method: `clear_proposals($entry_id)` saves to history before clearing
- History saving integrated into response handler methods:
  - `process_rejection()` - Saves rejected/invalid proposals
  - `process_acceptance()` - Saves accepted proposals
  - `process_authorization()` - Updates history with authorization
- Template variables: `$responded_proposal` available at top scope
